			<h2>Bayesian optimisation</h2>

			<p>Consider a typical problem setting for a Bayesian Optimization problem.</p>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>

			<p>Imagine you're on the engineering design team for a Formula 1 car. The team lead decided it would be worth a try to add a new side-wing to the vehicle. The length of the side-wing, however, can vary within some regulation constraints: 5cm - 40cm. Your job is to find the length of the wing that gives optimal performance as measured by the best lap time the driver is able to achieve.</p>

			<p>This is a typical setting for Bayesian Optimization. We're trying to optimize an unknown objective function y(x) - the vehicle's on track performance as a function of the side-wing length. The objective function is expensive to evaluate: it takes a long period of time to test a new prototype, and manufacturing a prototype component is costly. Our goal is to pick the wing lengths to evaluate such that we find the optimal design in a limited number of steps.</p>

			<p>You can manufacture a wing prototype in about a day, and the driver can test it on the track reporting their best time to you. There are only 5 days until the next race, however, so you have limited time to find the best design.</p>

			<p>The problem is that we don't know what wing lengths correspond to the best speeds. <strong>Hover tap over the graph on the right to see what possible relationships could look like.</strong></p>
