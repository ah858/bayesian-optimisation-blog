					Bayesian Optimization is a powerful tool for automatic optimization of design choices. It has been used extensively in applications ranging from hyperparameter tuning for automatic machine learning to optimizing manufacturing and experiment design. We'll start off by introducing a typical problem setting for Bayesian Optimization, and show how the key components of Bayesian Optimization can significantly improve upon a naive approach.
				</p>

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>
					Imagine you're on the engineering design team for a Formula One car. The team lead decided that redesigning the vehicle’s side wing may improve its cornering speed. A new shape has been proposed, however, the length of the side-wing, which can vary within the regulation constraints of 5cm - 40cm, is yet to be decided. Your job is to find the length of the wing that gives optimal performance as measured by the top cornering speed the driver is able to achieve.
				</p>

				<p>
					The biggest challenge is that it is both expensive and slow to test new wing sizes. Each wing size prototype takes around a week to manufacture, install on the vehicle and get tested by the driver. There are only a few weeks left until the next Grand Prix, however, so you have limited time to find the best design.

				<!-- <h3>Possible functions</h3> -->
				<p>
					This is a typical setting for Bayesian Optimization. We're trying to optimize an objective function \(f(x)\) - the vehicle's on track performance - as a function of the side-wing length \(x\). Unfortunately, we don't know what that function looks like: 
				</p>

				<!-- Posssible Functions Plot (inline) -->
		    	<div id="chart-possible-funcs"></div>
				<!-- <h2>Choosing points blindly</h2> -->
				<p>
					The main challenge is that the objective function is expensive to evaluate. In our problem, it takes a long period of time to test a new prototype, and manufacturing the prototype is costly. Therefore, we can only ever observe the objective function at a limited number of points. Each evaluation is precious, we can't waste them.
				</p>

				<p>
					For these reasons, we need an efficient testing strategy. The tools of Bayesian Optimization are designed for situations like this.
				</p>

		        <p>
					Before we get on to how they work, however, try to have a go at picking the points yourself. There are 5 weeks left until the next race, so use the evaluations wisely:

					There are multiple ways to approach picking which points to evaluate. We could try naively picking the points at random, or divide the design-space uniformly and perform a grid-search. However, both of these approaches would be inefficient - they ignore the feedback which we sequentially receive from each experiment.
				</p>

				<p>
					To pick the next point, we want to utilise the information about which previously evaluated inputs turned out to be good, and which ones turned out to be bad. We want to focus our search on the most promising areas of the design space.
				</p>

				<p>
					Instead of just picking side-wing lengths blindly, the central idea of Bayesian optimization is to fit a model to the data to inform that choice. This would allow us to predict what vehicle's cornering speed - our objective - might be for wing lengths we haven't tested yet. This can give us a proxy for what the most promising regions to explore might be.
				</p>

				<p>
					By using a model, we could formulate a more effective automated strategy: we can simply pick the side-wing that is predicted to give the highest cornering speed by the model.

					Starting with the setup on the right, let's see what would happen if we strictly followed the <i>"pick the best point predicted by the model strategy".</i>
				</p>
				<br> 

		    	<div id="explore-exploit-text1">
					<p>
						By picking only the best point as predicted by the model, we might eventually end up only picking points close to the one pretty good design that we found so far.

					<p>If we pick the best point that is predicted by the model, we end up choosing a point that is close to existing points we have already found.</p>
					<p>
						While doing so, we might be ignoring other unexplored parts of the search-space, where an even better design could be located.
					</p>


	<!-- 				<button id="button-explore-exploit-1">Pick naive point</button>
	 -->
					<p>This means that we have ignored the unexplored region of the search space (of smaller wing spans) where an even better design could be located.</p>

					<p>
						It should be clear that there is a trade-off between selecting inputs close to the 'best' points observed so far (exploiting) and traversing the design-space in search of more prospective regions (exploring). This trade-off plays a central role in Bayesian Optimization.

			    	<h3>The need for a <i>probabilistic</i> model</h3>
		    		<div id="explore-exploit-show-variance"></div>
					<p>How do we know where to explore? We only want to explore in areas where there is a relatively large potential of observing a value that could be optimal, i.e. in those areas where our predictor is uncertain. Hence, in order to explore effectively we need estimates of uncertainty from the predictive model that we're using.</p> 
				</div>

					<p>Our goal is to build a statistical picture of the function’s overall form given our observations of it. One convenient approach to modelling functions over continuous domains that allows for a full Bayesian Treatment are Gaussian Process. These are widely used in the Bayesian Optimization literature in applications.</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					How do we know where to explore? Naturally, there's little use in trying designs similar to the ones we've tried before that turned out to be bad. Intuitively, we want to explore in areas where we believe there is a high probability that the design will improve upon previous ones the most. This can happen both in places where the model's mean prediction is high, or where the model's mean prediction is low, but the uncertainty in that prediction is high. Even though the expected value at a given point x might be low, if the uncertainty is high enough, the probability of that point being the maximum might actually be substantial.
				</p>

				<p>
					To assess these high-risk high-reward regions, we need to be able to evaluate a notion of uncertainty in the model's predictions. To explore effectively, we need a model that can give us a full predictive distribution over the possible values for the objective. Hence, a key component of Bayesian Optimization is to utilise a probabilistic model. Having access to the predictive distribution from such a model allows us to ascertain the probability of each outcome.
				</p>

				<p>
					Hence, a model for Bayesian Optimization ought to maintain a statistical picture of the function’s overall form given our observations of it. Gaussian Processes are one popular approach to doing so for functions over continuous domains, as they give an analytical formula for the form of the predictive distribution. Here is an example:

				<h2>Decision Rule</h2>
			<p>
				So far, we discussed the tension between exploration and exploitation and the necessity for uncertainty estimation to balance the two. Bayesian Optimization is an automatic approach to making design choices, however; we're still missing a decision rule.
			</p>

			<p>
				Typically, in Bayesian Optimization approaches, one would define an acquisition function \alpha(x) which, loosely speaking, characterises the expected utility of picking a particular next input x. The next input x is then automatically picked as whichever one maximises that acquisition function.For instance, for our naive approach of picking the point with the best expected cornering speed as predicted by our model, we were guided by acquisition function alpha(x) that was equal to the expected predicted objective - alpha(x) = E[y(x)] - and we considered picking the point with the highest predicted objective:
			</p>
			<!-- Simple acquisition function plot - alpha(x) = the predictive mean -->

			<p>
				This acquisition function was too greedy, however, not taking the uncertainty in the predictions into account.
			</p>

			<p>
				This raises a question: what is the right acquisition function? From our goal, can we come up with an acquisition function that would lead us to the optimal rule for choosing an x?
